Cautions & Tips
--------------
- DO NOT delete any files from the application folder - all components are necessary
- The application is self-contained and doesn't require Python or FFmpeg to be installed
- For faster access, create a desktop shortcut or pin the application to your taskbar
- Downloaded files are saved to the folder you specify, not within the application folder
- If you move the application, move the entire folder, not just the .exe file

Troubleshooting
--------------
- If the application fails to start, ensure you're running the .exe from its original folder
- For format or download errors, check your internet connection and verify the URL is valid
- The application logs errors to a file in your home directory (.yt_downloader.log)

Thank you for using ADM Video Downloader!
