# Hover-Paste Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a hover-paste feature that shows the clipboard URL in the URL entry field when hovering over the paste button, with fade effects.

## Components Involved
- URLInputComponent (src/gui/components/url_input.py)
- Paste button
- URL entry field
- Clipboard handling

## Implementation Steps

1. Enhance URLInputComponent class:
   - Add event handlers for mouse hover (enterEvent/leaveEvent or event filter)
   - Add animation properties for fade effects
   - Add methods to preview and clear clipboard content

2. URL Validation:
   - Reuse existing URL validation pattern in paste_url method
   - Create a separate method to check if clipboard contains valid URL

3. Mouse Hover Implementation:
   - Add enterEvent method to detect when mouse enters paste button
   - Add leaveEvent method to detect when mouse leaves paste button
   - Use existing clipboard.paste() to get clipboard content

4. Fade Animation Implementation:
   - Use QPropertyAnimation for opacity effects
   - Create fade-in animation (duration: 300ms)
   - Create fade-out animation (duration: 300ms)
   - Connect animation states to URL entry visibility

5. Clipboard Preview Logic:
   - On hover, check clipboard for valid URL
   - If valid, show URL in entry field with fade-in effect
   - Store original URL entry content to restore later
   - Add visual indicator that content is a preview (e.g., different background color)

6. Restore Original State:
   - On mouse leave, restore original URL if paste button wasn't clicked
   - Apply fade-out effect when restoring original state

7. Preserve Functionality:
   - Maintain original paste button click behavior
   - Ensure URL validation still works properly
   - Make sure signals are emitted appropriately

## Technical Considerations
- Use QGraphicsOpacityEffect for fade animations
- Implement proper state management to track preview state
- Ensure clipboard is only accessed when necessary (performance)
- Handle edge cases (empty clipboard, invalid URLs, etc.)

## Testing Plan
1. Test hover behavior with valid URL in clipboard
2. Test hover behavior with invalid content in clipboard
3. Test clicking paste button during hover
4. Test moving mouse away without clicking
5. Test performance impact of continuous clipboard access
